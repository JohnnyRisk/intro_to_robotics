    "# A robotics company named Trax has created a line of small self-driving robots \n",
    "# designed to autonomously traverse desert environments in search of undiscovered\n",
    "# water deposits.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A Traxbot looks like a small tank. Each one is about half a meter long and drives\n",
    "# on two continuous metal tracks. In order to maneuver itself, a Traxbot can do one\n",
    "# of two things: it can drive in a straight line or it can turn. So to make a \n",
    "# right turn, A Traxbot will drive forward, stop, turn 90 degrees, then continue\n",
    "# driving straight.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This series of questions involves the recovery of a rogue Traxbot. This bot has \n",
    "# gotten lost somewhere in the desert and is now stuck driving in an almost-circle: it has\n",
    "# been repeatedly driving forward by some step size, stopping, turning a certain \n",
    "# amount, and repeating this process... Luckily, the Traxbot is still sending all\n",
    "# of its sensor data back to headquarters.\n",
